# Weekly ToDo Tracker

Link to slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FVZkNfx0yxSdnRzNBINjU6ZEvPf5_6DPG0LKwT8f0nM/edit?usp=sharing

## Context

- I like to organize and keep track of daily tasks

- It's reassuring to see progress and satisfying to check off items on list

- Thought of creating a to-do list but wanted to expand on the idea
  - Separate to-do list by days of the week
  - Add progress bar (daily and overall)
  - Allow users to personalize UI

## Demo Time!

### Project Directory Doesn't Exist:

- create React project

`npx create-react-app midterm`

- copy over code from repo

https://github.com/xinyunicorn/DynamicWebApps/tree/main/midterm

- make sure to install all the external libraries and dependencies

`npm install`

***continue below***

### Project Directory Exists:

- cd into the folder

`cd "C:\Users\xyzha\OneDrive\DWA\DynamicWebApps\midterm`

- run the code to get the site up and running!

`npm start`

## Possible Future Implementations/Features
- Add animation when progress bar completes
- Add better UI to make site more aesthetically pleasing
- Split each day of the week into separate pages instead of all on one page
  - Perhaps have home page change dynamically based on current day

## Questions/Feedback
- Should I split up larger files into more files?
- What other features would be cool to add?
