Each folder contains the class material, including the code and installs, from each class. The date when the class took place is noted in the commit message.

The homework for each week is also contained in the existing folder. The files that were changed when completing the homework are indicated by the commit message.

## So far, here are the folders where each homework can be found:

Week 2 Homework - user-rating

Week 3/4 Homework - comp-lib

Week 5 Homework - comp-lib-routes
